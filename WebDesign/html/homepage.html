						<p>Welcome to my website! I am a software developer for Produce Pro Software in the Chicago area. Recently, I’ve become proficient with web development through my professional work. I have a strong background in low level technologies from my Computer Engineering studies at Purdue. I have started pursuing personal technical projects, my first being this website.</p>

			  				<p>I started working at Produce Pro in July, 2018. This company has given me a great opportunity to get my feet wet in the world of web design. I had no prior web design experience,  but I was eager to learn. During my time at Produce Pro, I have worked on many projects ranging from backend request/response logic to web front end UI design. Produce Pro is a small company of welcoming programmers that write software to assist produce distributors. My experience here helped expose me to new technologies with more to come.</p>

			  				<h2>Purdue</h2>
			  				<p>My experience at Purdue was a mixed bag of grueling coursework and personal growth. Purdue’s first year engineering program helped my find the direction I was looking for. It was at this school that I fell in love with computing technology, and a better group of friends than I ever could have hoped for. I’m grateful for the challenges in my coursework that taught me how to find answers to difficult problems. Whenever I think back to the lessons I learned at this school, I am truly amazed by how much I grew, at Purdue.</p>

			  				<h2>Cedarburg</h2>
			  				<p>Getting to know how someone grew up is a good way to get to know how someone sees themselves in the world. For me, my introduction to the world was in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. A town too big for everyone to know each other,  but small and excluded enough to have an intimacy about it. Growing up in Cedarburg gave me a grounded yet sheltered view of the world.The most important lesson I  learned during this time in my life was to never shy away from mistakes, but to seek out the reasons behind them. I’m lucky to call Cedarburg my hometown.</p>

						<p>The idea of having a personal website was always appealing to me. This project was the first time that I had taken the time to work on a project on my own. I decided to build this website to apply the web development skills that I learned through my work to a personal project. All of the styling for this website was written and designed by me. </p>

							<h2>Dynamic QR Code Web app</h2>
							<p>I was looking into generating a QR code for my website, when I stumbled across dynamic QR code technology. The idea was to have a QR code that contains a static redirect URL. This URL can then be programmed to redirect traffic to a different destination. This has been my first real exposure to ground up web application design with custom content delivery infrastructure. The most exciting part of this project was designing and organizing the request logic for altering the backend state of the application. This project helped me to learn the basics of web development and content delivery.</p>
